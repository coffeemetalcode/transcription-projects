# Transcription Projects

The repository serves as an all purpose store for my various music transcription and notation projects both personal and professional. Notation projects are currently in one of four systems I use for such work - [Finale](https://www.finalemusic.com/), [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en), [Sibelius](https://www.avid.com/sibelius), and my favorite tool, [LilyPond](https://lilypond.org/). Each tool has its own paradigm and so will have its own area of the documentation.
